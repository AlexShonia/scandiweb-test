see how some parts work
write your own backend, test with postman
    + create app and router    
    + query function should be less prone to injections
        + dont directly add variabbles in sql queries
    + return status codes
    + add request class
    go through it again to see if anything is extra

+ implement add product page ui funcitonality
adhere to add product page example ui
+ adhere task id specifications
make add product page more beauitiful
+ go through TODO-s inside code

+ connect to react frontend
+ add home page
+ add add page
+ add delete funcitonality
why have getters and setters if properties are public anyway?
why do we get product object and delete in productDao and not just delete straight up?
