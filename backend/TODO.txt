see how some parts work
write your own backend, test with postman
    create app and router    
    query function should be less prone to injections
        dont directly add variabbles in sql queries
    return status codes
    add request class

+ connect to react frontend
+ add home page
+ add add page
+ add delete funcitonality
why have getters and setters if properties are public anyway?
why do we get product object and delete in productDao and not just delete straight up?
